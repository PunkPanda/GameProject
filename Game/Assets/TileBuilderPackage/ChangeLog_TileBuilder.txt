========
- Replaced backslashes to slashes for Mac users in filepaths. (Filepath would otherwise return errors).
- The Tile Builder now works from inside the TileBuilderPackage folder, instead of dragging everything to your root.
- Fixed an issue where on Mac systems, the tiles were being placed with an offset from the mouse position. (Thanks Zbyszek!)
- Included credits to Kenney Vleugels for his awesome sprites.
